The College took a modest start with the Center for Computer Science, established in the Center for Solid State Physics, Quaid-e-Azam (New) Campus, Lahore, in 1988. The first degree program offered by the Center was a one-year Post Graduate Diploma (PGD) in Computer Science. 24 students were registered in this program during the first year. The Center was upgraded to Department of Computer Science in 1991. The Department started 2-year (4-semesters) PGD leading to MSc in Computer Science under the annual system. In its first batch, the 15 students were admitted to this program. The number doubled the following year.</h3><h3 class="text-success">This App is developed by Ahmed Ali, BS Software Engineering Student Batch 2011-2015</h3></div>
